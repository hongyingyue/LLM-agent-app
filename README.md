## 📋 Overview

Zero-Agent is a powerful, containerized system that combines a Python backend with a modern frontend to create an intelligent agent-based architecture. It's designed to be scalable, maintainable, and easy to deploy.

## ✨ Features

- 🐳 Docker-based deployment for consistent environments
- 🔄 Real-time communication between frontend and backend
- 🎯 Modular architecture for easy extension
- 🛠️ Comprehensive testing suite
- 📚 Detailed documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.x


### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hongyingyue/Zero-Agent.git
cd Zero-Agent
```

2. Start the services using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to run the services manually:

1. Start the backend service:

```

2. In a new terminal window, start the frontend server:
```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server 3000
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a modern microservices architecture:

- **Frontend**: Web-based interface served on port 3000
- **Backend**: Python-based API service
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment for all services

## 🧪 Testing
